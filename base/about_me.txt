Hello!

My name is Brennan Castillo. I'm a computer science Major and this is my second time taking Computing 2.
I was confused by a lot of concepts and was busy with my job that pushed me to the back of the class.
With a little more flexibility, I think I can manage and make it through the semester with a little more help
with my TA's and Mr. Andy. This would help me enable a career in the Computer Science field. I am hoping to be a successful computer programmer and build apps
that could excel in commerce or do something life changing in the future.
